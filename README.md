tribapps-gis
============  

A repo storing various GIS data we've made or use in our hacking that we'd like to make publicly available.

* DuPage County Board shapefiles -- found in Tribune data archives
* Kendall County Board shapefiles -- received from Kendall County's GIS office
* Lake County Board shapefiles -- made from a KML file found at http://gis2.co.lake.il.us/output/kmz/cboard2012.kml
* McHenry County Board shapefiles -- found in Tribune data archives
* Will County Board shapefiles -- received from Will County's GIS office
* Our custom-made Illinois judicial shapefiles, which we built by hand looking at individual counties on maps located at http://www.state.il.us/court/circuitcourt/circuitmap/map1.asp

Many other shapefiles are included, most are included unaltered from public sources.

Also included is a definitions.py file which is used by [django-boundaryservice](https://github.com/newsapps/django-boundaryservice).
